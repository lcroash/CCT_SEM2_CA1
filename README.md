Semester 2 - Continuous Assessment 1 - Forecasting Methodologies in a Big Data Context

This paper examines the practical application of neural networks in the context of big data analytics, with a particular focus on improving time series analysis. We consider the current landscape of data storage, with an emphasis on the need for efficient and cost-effective modelling and preprocessing techniques/ platforms. The paper discusses the selection of data storage architectures, cloud-based and on-premise solutions, and the consideration of workforce skills, tech debt and cost for infrastructure management. With a focus on financial forecasting for a large retail business, the paper compares advanced processing tools, machine learning technologies, and neural networks to determine the most effective ways to improve forecast accuracy. We presents a comparison of various time series analysis methods, including classical statistical approaches, machine learning models, and deep learning neural networks, highlighting their strengths and weaknesses in handling datasets with slightly different compositions.. 

Work is carried out leveraging Hadoop, Spark, Keras, Tensorflow, Prophet and Scikit Learn.
EDA performed to analyse time series, forecasting models developed and evaluated.
